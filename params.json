I ran these experiments on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz model 58 coming from CPU family 6 with stepping = 9, microcode 0x12 at cpu MHz =  1667.327 with a cache size = 8192 KB. and ram total of 32. This is not an exhaustive comparison since I decided to go with a simple calculation of pi. The code that I ran was:\r\n\r\n\r\n### The code I used\r\nA simple calculation of pi, I took this code almost exactly from David Bolton's blog.\r\n    \r\n    from decimal import *\r\n    import time\r\n \r\n    getcontext().prec = 50\r\n    s = Decimal(1);   #Sign\r\n    pi = Decimal(3);\r\n    n = 500000\r\n\r\n    start_time = time.time()\r\n    for i in range (2, n * 2, 2):\r\n        pi = pi + s * (Decimal(4) / (Decimal(i) * (Decimal(i) + Decimal(1)) * (Decimal(i) + Decimal(2))))\r\n        s = -1 * s\r\n    print (\"\\nApproximate value of PI :\",pi,\" for \",n)\r\n    print(\"\\nIt took--- %s seconds ---\" % (time.time() - start_time))\r\n\r\n### Results on a pure installation of python, no MKL:\r\nThe results are rather slow, the time is printed at the end, it took more than 54 seconds to run\r\n    /usr/bin/python3.5 ~/Documents/eraseme.py \r\n\r\n    Approximate value of PI : 3.1415926535897932404626433832695028841972913993874  for  500000\r\n    It took--- 54.34163188934326 seconds ---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Results of Intel distribution for python:\r\nThis is A LOT faster, It took barely 1 second to run.\r\n    \r\n    python ~/Documents/eraseme.py\r\n\r\n    Approximate value of PI : 3.1415926535897932404626433832695028841972913993874  for  500000\r\n    It took--- 1.027895212173462 seconds ---\r\n\r\n### Results of Anaconda:\r\nAt this point, anaconda is not installing. I will come back to this when conda fixes up its latest bug.\r\n",
